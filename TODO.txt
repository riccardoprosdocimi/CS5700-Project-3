- Get rid of our names from the top of the files
- Verify data length and total length calculation
- Might need ret_addr from sock.recvfrom
- The fuck does this mean:
    "Furthermore, your code must be defensive, i.e. you must check the validity of IP
    headers from the remote server. Is the remote IP correct? Is the checksum correct?
    Does the protocol identifier match the contents of the encapsulated header?"
- Fragment flag in IP headers
- More robust error handling in IP.unpack when packet is not IPV4 (is this check even necessary since the socket type will likely only deliver IPv4 packets?)

DONE:
- Consolidate all the struct.unpack calls into one format string
